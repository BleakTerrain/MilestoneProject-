# Milestone Project - WebCV Experiment

As part of my studies with the Code Institute I build this WebCV Experiment. 
I refer to it as an experiment because, although the UX is good, I wanted to focus more on functionality. 
There is navigation, links, downloadable content and a form as well as being responsive, which makes the content more engaging. 

UX
This website was intended to be as easy to use as possible and to include simple navigation. The choice of color schemes were made consciously as satifying and easy to read color. 
This was enable a better user experience. 

User Stories: 
"As a small business owner, I don't have much time. I want to the content and layout to be easy to use and to follow"
"As the head of a digital media startup, I have a little technical knowlege and would like access to the developers previous code. "
"As a self-employed potter/etsy creator I want to trust my developer - I'd like an easy way to contact them and for things not to feel to technical and unaccessible"

There are no wireframes available for this project. Wireframes would have been useful in the planning stage and will be implemented at the beginning in the future. 

Features
|Existing Feature| What it does|
|---|---|
|Navbar|The Navbar allows the user to navigate through the website. In this case it also helps break up the page and creates an easy to read UX.|
|Download link| There is a CV download link on this page.|
|Timeline|There is a work-history timeline on the Resume page|
|Form|There is a contact form located on the contact page. This is not linked up yet as it requires further knowledge|



Features Left to Implement

Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
