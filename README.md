# Milestone Project - WebCV Experiment

As part of my studies with the Code Institute I build this WebCV Experiment. 
I refer to it as an experiment because, although the UX is good, I wanted to focus more on functionality. 
There is navigation, links, downloadable content and a form as well as being responsive, which makes the content more engaging. 

UX
This website was intended to be as easy to use as possible and to include simple navigation. The choice of color schemes were made consciously as satifying and easy to read color. 
This was enable a better user experience. 

User Stories: 
"As a small business owner, I don't have much time. I want to the content and layout to be easy to use and to follow"</br>
"As the head of a digital media startup, I have a little technical knowlege and would like access to the developers previous code. "</br>
"As a self-employed potter/etsy creator I want to trust my developer - I'd like an easy way to contact them and for things not to feel to technical and unaccessible" </br>

There are no wireframes available for this project. Wireframes would have been useful in the planning stage and will be implemented at the beginning in the future. 

Features

### Existing Features: 

|Existing Feature| What it does|
|---|---|
|Navbar|The Navbar allows the user to navigate through the website. In this case it also helps break up the page and creates an easy to read UX.|
|Download link| There is a CV download link on this page. There is a similar link for the README.md but it is not entirely downloadable|
|Timeline|There is a work-history timeline on the Resume page|
|Form|There is a contact form located on the contact page. This is not linked up yet as it requires further knowledge|


### Features Left to Implement: 

|Features to implement|What would it do|
|---|---|
|Better UI|At this point the UI is fairly basic, it would be preferable to work on this over time|
|Form connection|At this point the form is only there as a placeholder and down't really do anything. This is the next step|


### Technologies Used

This website uses HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and FontAwesome. 
It was built using the AWS Cloud 9 IDE


### Responsive UI
As this site is made for Mobile-First, the Bootstrap row and column frameworks were used. 
There is one media query for smaller screens to manage the image and name/intro card sizes. There was some testing into changing the color scheme for smaller screens but this didn't look as intended and was changed back. 
A conscious choice was made at this stage to avoid any drastic layout changes between desktop and smaller screens to make the page easier to understand for those who aren't as technically minded. 
The layout and general feel of the site works and looks better on smaller screen. One of the features left to implement is a UI "revamp" for larger screens.

### Deployment
This website was not intended for professional use but instead for experimental use to utilize skills from learnt during the Code Institute Full Stack Course. 
Therefore, the best option for deployment was the most simple - using GitHub Pages. This was a straightforward process that enabled me to view the published site with ease.
